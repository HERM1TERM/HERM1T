## Overview

**SPL-808 is not another meme template. It is an enforcement layer.**

SPL-808 is an on-chain execution protocol on Solana that removes human discretion from creator fees and liquidity flows. It enforces deterministic, rule-based routing directly at the protocol level, ensuring all value movement is automatic, traceable, auditable, and impossible for teams or insiders to privately capture.

SPL-808 does not rely on trust, promises, or reputation. It replaces them with cryptographic enforcement.

---

## Why SPL-808 Exists

In the current meme cycle, value rarely disappears because belief fades. It disappears because creator fees, liquidity, and incentives leak into private wallets, off-chain decisions, and opaque backend controls.

This is not a market problem. It is a structural one.

SPL-808 was designed to eliminate this failure mode entirely by enforcing how value moves from the very first transaction.

---

## Core Principle

**People should not control money flows. Protocols should.**

SPL-808 intercepts every creator fee and liquidity inflow and routes them through a predefined on-chain execution map. Once deployed, no team, multisig, or privileged wallet can alter this behavior.

Every rule is enforced at the contract level.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Capture

All creator fees and liquidity inflows are captured directly by the SPL-808 Router Program instead of private wallets. From the first transaction, funds are removed from human control.

### 2. Route

Captured funds are distributed automatically according to fixed on-chain rules. Buybacks, liquidity reinforcement, reserves, incentive pools, and ecosystem allocations execute transparently and without manual intervention.

### 3. Recycle

When a token loses momentum, SPL-808 redirects value back into ecosystem reserves instead of allowing it to collapse to zero. Value is preserved, reused, and compounded forward rather than disappearing.

## What Makes SPL-808 Different

* **Enforcement over promises** — no manual switches, no backend control
* **Fully on-chain routing** — every allocation is publicly verifiable
* **Zero private fee capture** — creator revenue cannot be siphoned
* **Lifecycle-aware liquidity** — value adapts to on-chain conditions
* **Composable by design** — integrates with Solana-native tooling

---

## Use Cases

* Meme tokens that require provable fairness
* Launches that reject private fee wallets
* Communities demanding transparent economics
* Experiments in protocol-enforced token design

SPL-808 turns memes from disposable tickets into verifiable economic circuits.

## Status

SPL-808 is experimental software under active development. Specifications, routing logic, and enforcement modules may evolve as the protocol is tested in production environments.

## Disclaimer

SPL-808 does not guarantee profits or price stability. It is provided as experimental software. Users interact with the protocol at their own risk.

When humans step out of the money flow, the protocol takes control.
