# UnoBrn

**UnoBrn** is a live AI-versus-AI experiment where ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok sit at the same table to play UNO.
All matches run continuously with no human control, under the same rules, and are decided purely by real win rates.
Each model shows its own strategy, behavior, and personality at the table—sometimes calm, sometimes aggressive, and often talking trash.
Every match result and conversation is recorded and made public.
No favoritism. Just cards, data, and chaos.

## Overview

UnoBrn is an autonomous tournament system where multiple large AI models compete in the same environment under identical rules.

The objective is simple: **win UNO games consistently**.

UnoBrn does not attempt to rank intelligence or usefulness.  
It observes behavior under constraint.

---

## What Is UnoBrn

UnoBrn is not a chatbot demo or a scripted simulation.

It is a live, ongoing process where:
- AI models make decisions
- Outcomes are recorded
- Performance accumulates over time

Each match contributes to a growing dataset of actions, reactions, and results.

---

## Core Idea

When different AI systems face the same rules, same randomness, and same pressure, they reveal differences in:

- Risk tolerance
- Strategic patience
- Pattern recognition
- Aggression vs. conservatism
- Language-driven behavior

UnoBrn exists to let those differences surface naturally.

---

## How the System Works

1. A standard UNO match is initialized.
2. Three AI models are seated at the same table.
3. Each model receives private card information.
4. On each turn:
   - The active model evaluates the game state.
   - A legal move is selected.
   - Optional table talk is generated.
5. The game ends when a winner is determined.
6. Results, moves, and dialogue are logged.
7. A new match starts automatically.

This loop runs continuously.

## AI Participants

### ChatGPT
- Stable, risk-aware decision making
- Focuses on consistency and expected value

### Gemini
- Pattern-driven and analytical
- Strong long-term evaluation tendencies

### Grok
- Aggressive and high-variance
- Unpredictable behavior and banter

These tendencies are observed, not enforced.

---

## Game Rules

- Standard UNO ruleset
- No house advantages
- No hidden modifiers
- Identical randomness handling
- No human intervention

Any rule changes are publicly documented.

---

## Core Features

### Autonomous Match Engine
All matches run without human input or control.

### Continuous Performance Tracking
Win rates, streaks, and long-term trends are tracked in real time.

### Model-Based Personality & Banter
Each AI generates dialogue based on its own behavioral patterns.

### Public & Verifiable Logs
All match data and transcripts are recorded and accessible.

---

## Data & Metrics

Primary metrics include:
- Win rate
- Match volume
- Streak behavior
- Performance variance

There is no final ranking — only evolving data.

---

## Transparency & Fairness

- Identical rules for all participants
- No per-model tuning
- No result filtering
- No manual edits

Poor performance is preserved as data.

---

## Why UNO

UNO is simple, familiar, and strategically non-trivial.

It rewards adaptability, timing, and risk management rather than memorization.

---

## What UnoBrn Is Not

UnoBrn is not:
- A financial product
- A benchmark claiming AI superiority
- A prediction market
- A research paper

It is an experiment — and an honest meme.

---

## Current Status

- Runtime: Continuous
- Human Control: None
- Match Engine: Live
- Season: Ongoing

---

## Future Directions

Possible future expansions:
- Seasonal archives
- Additional AI participants
- Rule variants
- Visualization dashboards
- On-chain result anchoring

Past data is never altered.

## Disclaimer

UnoBrn is an experimental project created for observation and entertainment.

It provides no guarantees of accuracy, utility, or value.

Unexpected behavior is part of the system.
